## Heartbeat Classification Project (2023) [Github Project](https://github.com/wadie999/master-notes/tree/main/machine-learning/heart%20sound%20classification) + [Report](https://github.com/wadie999/master-notes/blob/main/machine-learning/heart%20sound%20classification/report-heart.pdf)


Developed at Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, this project employs machine learning techniques to classify heartbeats into different types—normal, murmurs, and artifacts—from audio recordings. Utilizing both supervised (Random Forest, SVM, k-NN) and unsupervised (KMeans) learning approaches, the project effectively identifies and classifies cardiac sounds, enhancing diagnostic capabilities for early detection of heart anomalies.

## Beatbox Sound Recognition Project (2023) [Github Project](https://github.com/wadie999/master-notes/tree/main/machine-learning/beatbox-sound-classification) + [Report](https://github.com/wadie999/master-notes/blob/main/machine-learning/beatbox-sound-classification/projet_beatbox-5.pdf)


The Beatbox Sound Recognition Project at Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier focuses on the recognition and classification of beatbox sound samples using advanced machine learning algorithms. Leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Means clustering, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, the project showcases the application of machine learning in processing and categorizing complex audio data, offering new avenues in digital music analysis and creative endeavors.

## Edmonds-Karp Algorithm (2022) [Notebook](https://github.com/wadie999/Edmond-karp/blob/main/Edmond%20(1)%20(1).ipynb) + [Report](https://github.com/wadie999/Edmond-karp/blob/main/edmond_karp%20(3)%20(1).pdf)


This project at Université Clermont Auvergne, under supervision of Mr LIMOUZY Vincent, involves the implementation of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, an optimized approach to the Ford-Fulkerson method for computing maximum flow in a flow network. The project focused on utilizing a dictionary-based graph structure for simplicity and effectiveness in managing flow networks. The implementation was tested on various graph sizes to analyze the algorithm's complexity and efficiency, demonstrating its practical application in solving network flow problems.

## Graphic Communication Protocol Design (2022) [Notebook](https://github.com/wadie999/Protocole-communication-graphique-reseaux/blob/main/protocol_2.py) + [Report](https://github.com/wadie999/Protocole-communication-graphique-reseaux/blob/main/Rapport%20projet.pdf)

This project tasked us with creating a communication protocol from scratch. My partner and I chose to innovate by using triangles instead of the traditional rectangular units, like those used in QR codes. This decision led us to explore the concept of "pavage de triangles," or tiling with triangles. We implemented this idea by developing a system that recursively paves smaller triangles within a larger triangular framework, each serving as a distinct unit of encoded data.
